# comrade-pet-blocker
Blocks dastardly unwanted pets.


# Installation
Make sure you fill out config.json. There is an example config.example.json you can copy.  
The token is your Discord bot token.  

`npm run build`  
`npm run start`  

That's it.

# How it works
Basically, you want to put your banned images into the banned folder.  
You can do this while the server is running, doesn't matter when.  

Then, any message posted with the banned image (even if it's a custom emoji) will be banned.  
It's surprisingly accurate.
